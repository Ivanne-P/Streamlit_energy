# Streamlit_energy
Capstone project on the electricity market in France: prediction electricity consumption from RTE open data and temperature.

## Objectives
● Analyse the profile of electricity consumption and production at national and regional level
● Create a predictive model of regional consumption as a function of temperature
● Design an interactive dashboard to analyse and compare the profile of regions in the energy transition (rankings, maps, indicators)

## Deliverables
● Data exploration, visualisation and pre-processing report
● Modelling report with performance analysis of the predictive model
● Final report with defence in English

## Tools
Python – Scikit-Learn library – Seaborn – Plotly – Streamlit
